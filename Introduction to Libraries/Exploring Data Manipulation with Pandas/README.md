Exploring Data Manipulation with Pandas: A Practical Example

This code snippet demonstrates the use of the Pandas library in Python for data manipulation and analysis. It covers various operations such as creating dataframes, filtering data, calculating statistics, and modifying data.

Example 1: Creating a DataFrame with numerical data stored in a dictionary. It includes columns labeled 'X', 'Y', and 'Z', each containing a list of values.

Example 2: Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary containing information about exam scores, attempts, and qualification status of students. Custom index labels are assigned. The dataset includes missing (NaN) values.

Example 3: Slicing the DataFrame to retrieve the first three rows.

Example 4: Selecting specific columns ('name' and 'score') from the DataFrame.

Example 5: Filtering data to select rows where the 'attempts' column has values greater than 2.

Example 6: Filtering data to identify rows with missing 'score' values.

Example 7: Filtering data to select rows where the 'score' is greater than or equal to 15.

Example 8: Combining conditions using logical operators to select rows with attempts less than 2 and scores greater than 15.

Example 9: Modifying a specific value in the DataFrame by accessing it using both column and index labels.

Example 10: Calculating the sum of the 'attempts' column.

Example 11: Calculating the mean of the 'score' column.

Example 12: Adding a new row to the DataFrame using the .loc method.

Example 13: Adding a new column 'students' to the DataFrame with all values set to 'yes'.
