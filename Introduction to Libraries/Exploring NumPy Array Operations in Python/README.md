Exploring NumPy Array Operations in Python

This code snippet demonstrates various operations using the NumPy library, a popular numerical computing package in Python.

Example 1 - Array Addition:
The first example showcases array addition using NumPy arrays. Two 2x3 arrays, 'a' and 'b', are defined and then added element-wise to create a new array 'sum'. The result is printed to the console.

Example 2 - Creating a 3D Array:
In this example, a 3x3x3 array 'a' is created using a list comprehension and then reshaped to a 3D structure. This illustrates how NumPy can efficiently handle multi-dimensional arrays.

Example 3 - Horizontal Stacking:
Here, two 2x3 arrays, 'a1' and 'a2', are horizontally stacked using the np.hstack() function. This operation concatenates the arrays side by side along the columns.

Example 4 - Vertical Stacking:
The final example demonstrates vertical stacking. Two 3x2 arrays, 'a1' and 'a2', are stacked vertically using the np.vstack() function. This results in a larger array with the rows of 'a2' positioned below the rows of 'a1'.
