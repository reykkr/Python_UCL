Computing the Sum of Integers and Adding to a Variable in Python

This code snippet defines a Python function named sum(a, b) that calculates the sum of integers within a specified range [a, b]. It employs a loop to iterate through the range and accumulates the sum in the result variable. The main part of the code sets the value of variable a to 10 and calls the sum() function with arguments 5 and 10, storing the result in variable b. The sum of a and b is then calculated and printed. The code demonstrates how to compute the sum of integers in a range and manipulate variables in Python.
