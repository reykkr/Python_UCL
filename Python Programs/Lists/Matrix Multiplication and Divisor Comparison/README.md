Matrix Multiplication and Divisor Comparison

This Python code demonstrates two different functionalities. Firstly, it defines a function multi(list1, list2) to multiply two matrices using a nested loop approach, and it also employs the NumPy library's matrix multiplication function for comparison. The code calculates the product of two example matrices, matrix1 and matrix2. Secondly, the code defines a function find_divisors(n) that finds and returns the divisors of a given number. It then takes two input numbers from the user, finds their divisors, and compares the sums of divisors. If the sums are equal, it prints True, indicating that the two numbers have equal divisor sums; otherwise, it prints False. This code showcases matrix multiplication and divisor calculations in Python.
