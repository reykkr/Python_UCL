Student Grade Analysis and Performance Assessment

This Python script enables users to input grades for a specified number of students, calculates the average grade, and identifies the number of students who have passed based on their grades. The script starts by prompting the user to input the number of students. Then, it iterates through a loop, collecting grades for each student and calculating the total sum of grades. After calculating the average grade, it counts how many students have grades above the average, identifying them as "passing" students. Finally, the script outputs the average grade and the count of students who passed. This tool can be useful for educators to quickly assess the performance of a group of students based on their grades and determine the proportion of students who meet or exceed the average performance.
