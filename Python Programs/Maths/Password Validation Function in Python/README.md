Password Validation Function in Python

This Python script defines a password validation function that checks the strength of a user-entered password based on certain criteria. The criteria include a minimum length of 8 characters, at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, and a minimum of two digits. The script prompts the user to input a password and then uses the valid function to determine if the provided password meets the specified requirements. The outcome of the validation is displayed to the user. However, there is an issue in the script where the return statement is placed incorrectly within the loop, leading to potential incorrect validation results.
