The code reads data from a text file, preprocesses it, performs statistical calculations (mean, mode, standard deviation, percentile), generates scatter plots and time series plots, and saves the processed data to a CSV file. The code aims to analyze and visualize the data from the file, with a focus on queue lengths.

a. The code reads data from a text file located at "C:/Users/m_a_g/Desktop/FinalExam-EntityLogger1.txt" using pandas' read_table function. It skips the first 12 rows and then stores the data in a pandas DataFrame named 'df'.

b. It drops two columns ('this.SimTime/1[h]' and 'this.obj') from the DataFrame 'df'.

c. The code renames three columns in 'df' to more readable names: '[Queue1].QueueLength' becomes 'Queue1', '[Queue2].QueueLength' becomes 'Queue2', and '[Queue3].QueueLength' becomes 'Queue3'.

d. The code removes duplicate rows from 'df', computes the mode of the 'Queue1' column and fills missing values in 'Queue1' with the mode value. It drops rows with missing values in 'Queue2' and converts the 'Queue1', 'Queue2', and 'Queue3' columns to numeric data types.

e. For each row in the DataFrame 'df', if the value in the 'Queue1', 'Queue2', or 'Queue3' columns is greater than 70, it replaces the value with the mean value of that column. Additionally, a new column 'Queue4' is added to 'df' with random integer values between 2 and 25.

g. The code calculates and prints the mean, mode, and standard deviation for the 'Queue1', 'Queue2', and 'Queue3' columns.

h. It calculates the 90th percentile of the 'Queue1' column and prints the result.

i. The processed DataFrame 'df' is saved to a CSV file at "C:/Users/m_a_g/Desktop/exam.csv".

j. A scatter plot is created using 'Queue1' values on the x-axis and 'Queue2' values on the y-axis. Grid lines with dashed style are added to the plot.

k. The plot is further customized by adding x and y labels, a title, and displaying the plot using plt.show().

l. Four line plots are created in a 2x2 grid layout, displaying the time series data from 'Queue1', 'Queue2', 'Queue3', and 'Queue4'. Subplot labels (1, 2, 3, 4) are also shown.

m. Similar to the previous step, four line plots are created in a vertical layout (4x1), showing the time series data for 'Queue1', 'Queue2', 'Queue3', and 'Queue4'. Subplot labels are included.
