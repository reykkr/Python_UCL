linear regression

a. A scatter plot is created with the data points from the arrays 'x' and 'y', displaying the relationship between the two variables.

b. Linear regression is performed on the data using the stats.linregress function. The slope, intercept, correlation coefficient (r), p-value, and standard error of the slope are extracted from the result. The linear regression line is then plotted over the scatter plot.

c. The first 8 data points from 'x' and 'y' are used as training data, while the remaining points are used as test data. A polynomial regression model of degree 4 is fitted to the training data using np.polyfit, and a polynomial function is created using np.poly1d.

d. The polynomial model is evaluated at x = 8.2, and the resulting y value is plotted on the linear regression line. The point is marked with a red circle using the 'ms' (marker size), 'mec' (marker edge color), and 'mfc' (marker face color) parameters.

Finally, the plots are displayed using plt.show().
