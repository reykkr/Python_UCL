The code generates synthetic data, creates a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between 'x' and 'y', performs polynomial regression of degree 4, calculates and prints the R-squared scores for training and testing data, and finally, predicts 'y' values for specific 'x' values using the trained polynomial regression model. This code demonstrates basic data generation, visualization, polynomial regression, and model evaluation concepts.

a. The code generates 200 random samples from a normal distribution with a mean of 6 and a standard deviation of 2. These samples are stored in the variable 'n' and are assigned to the variable 'x' as well.

b. Another set of 200 random samples is generated from a normal distribution with a mean of 300 and a standard deviation of 40. These samples are divided element-wise by the 'x' values, resulting in a 'y' array.

c. A scatter plot is created using 'x' as the x-axis values and 'y' as the y-axis values. This plot visualizes the relationship between 'x' and 'y'.

d. The code splits the data into training and testing sets. The first 160 values of 'x' and 'y' are used as training data, while the remaining values are used as testing data. Two separate scatter plots are created for training and testing data points using green and red colors, respectively.

e. The code prints the predicted 'y' value from the 'regmodel' for two specific 'x' values, 4.3 and 8.5.
