Unit Conversion and Document Manipulation in Python

This Python script showcases the usage of various unit conversion functions and document manipulation capabilities. The script defines three conversion functions: mile_to_km, celsius_to_fahrenheit, and inch_to_cm, which convert distances and temperature values between different units. It then demonstrates the usage of these functions by importing them from the conversions module. Additionally, the script imports the docx module to manipulate Word documents, although this functionality is not directly used in the provided code snippet. This example highlights how Python can be used to perform unit conversions and interact with document formats for various practical purposes.
