Matrix Operations and Rotation Checker in Python

This Python script demonstrates a menu-driven program that allows users to perform various operations on two given matrices. The operations include adding matrices, multiplying matrices, and checking if one matrix is a rotation of another. The script takes user input for the desired operation and performs the corresponding task using nested loops and functions. The matrix addition is performed by element-wise addition, matrix multiplication follows standard rules, and the rotation check is done by comparing the transposed version of one matrix with the other. The program continues to prompt the user for options until they choose to exit. This script showcases basic matrix operations and a simple rotation checking function in Python.
