Digit Frequency Counter

This Python program takes two numeric inputs, n and i, and calculates the frequency of the digit i in the number n. It checks if the second input is a single-digit number and then iterates through the digits of n, counting the occurrences of digit i. The program provides an output that shows how many times the digit i appears in the number n.
